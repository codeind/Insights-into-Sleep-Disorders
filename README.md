# Insights-into-Sleep-Disorders
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a synthetic dataset focused on sleep disorders, using Python and Tableau to visualize and understand various sleep-related issues. The dataset is designed to provide insights into the relationships between lifestyle factors, cardiovascular health, and the presence of sleep disorders. 

### **Project Overview:**
The dataset includes 400 rows and 13 columns, covering a wide range of factors affecting sleep health and lifestyle. This analysis aims to understand how factors like sleep duration, quality, physical activity, stress levels, cardiovascular health, and BMI category are linked to sleep disorders such as Insomnia and Sleep Apnea. Through detailed visualizations and statistical analysis, this repository helps to explore the impact of these factors on sleep health.

### **Dataset Structure:**
The dataset is structured with several key features that offer a holistic view of an individual's lifestyle and health. The columns in the dataset are:

1. **Person ID**: A unique identifier for each individual in the dataset.
2. **Gender**: The gender of the individual (Male/Female).
3. **Age**: The age of the individual in years.
4. **Occupation**: The occupation or profession of the individual.
5. **Sleep Duration (hours)**: The number of hours the individual sleeps per day.
6. **Quality of Sleep (scale: 1-10)**: A subjective rating of sleep quality, where 1 indicates poor quality and 10 indicates excellent quality.
7. **Physical Activity Level (minutes/day)**: The number of minutes the individual engages in physical activity daily.
8. **Stress Level (scale: 1-10)**: A subjective rating of the stress level experienced by the individual, ranging from 1 (low stress) to 10 (high stress).
9. **BMI Category**: The BMI classification of the individual, such as Underweight, Normal, or Overweight.
10. **Blood Pressure (systolic/diastolic)**: The individual's blood pressure, expressed as systolic over diastolic values.
11. **Heart Rate (bpm)**: The individual's resting heart rate, in beats per minute.
12. **Daily Steps**: The number of steps the individual takes on a daily basis.
13. **Sleep Disorder**: The type of sleep disorder present, such as None, Insomnia, or Sleep Apnea.

### **Key Insights and Analysis:**
- **Comprehensive Sleep Metrics**: The analysis investigates sleep duration and quality, providing an understanding of how lifestyle factors contribute to overall sleep health.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: The project focuses on the impact of daily physical activity, stress levels, and BMI on sleep quality and the likelihood of sleep disorders.
- **Cardiovascular Health**: Blood pressure and heart rate data are analyzed to explore the relationship between sleep health and cardiovascular conditions.
- **Sleep Disorder Analysis**: Special attention is given to the occurrence of sleep disorders, particularly Insomnia and Sleep Apnea, based on the dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns or correlations between these disorders and other factors such as stress, age, BMI, or physical activity levels.

### **Visualizations:**
The repository utilizes Python for data manipulation and analysis, with the help of libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to generate insightful visualizations. Key charts include:
- Distribution of sleep duration across individuals.
- Correlation matrices to understand relationships between physical activity, stress, and sleep quality.
- Comparison of sleep quality between individuals with different BMI categories or occupations.
- Analysis of the frequency of sleep disorders by age group, gender, and lifestyle habits.

### **Sleep Disorder Categories:**
- **None**: Individuals without any recognized sleep disorders.
- **Insomnia**: Individuals with difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep, leading to poor sleep quality and daytime dysfunction.
- **Sleep Apnea**: Individuals experiencing interrupted breathing during sleep, often leading to fragmented sleep and associated health risks.

### **Acknowledgement:**
It is important to note that the dataset used in this analysis is synthetic and created solely for illustrative purposes. It is not based on real-world data but designed to simulate realistic scenarios for the analysis of sleep-related health issues.

### **Project Objective:**
This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the interdependencies between lifestyle habits, physical health, and sleep disorders. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques and powerful visualizations, this repository serves as a resource for those interested in exploring how factors like physical activity, stress, and cardiovascular health contribute to sleep health and disorders.

### **Technologies Used:**
- **Python**: For data processing, analysis, and generating visualizations using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Tableau**: For interactive visualizations and a deeper dive into the dataset, enabling users to explore the relationships between variables.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For documenting the analysis process and results, providing an interactive environment for further exploration.

This repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of sleep health, using data analysis and visualization techniques to uncover actionable insights that can contribute to better health and lifestyle decisions.
